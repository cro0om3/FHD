NEWTON SMART HOME LOGO SETUP
=============================

To display your company logo in the header:

1. Save your Newton Smart Home logo as one of these filenames:
   - newton_logo.png (RECOMMENDED)
   - newton_logo.svg
   - logo.png
   - logo.svg

2. Place the file in this "data" folder

3. The app will automatically detect and display it in the top-right corner of the header

Current Setup:
- If no logo file is found, a blue gradient placeholder with "NEWTON" text will be shown
- The logo will be displayed at 120px width with automatic height
- Supports both PNG and SVG formats

Your logo from the attachment should be saved here as: newton_logo.png
